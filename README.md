# Feedreader project: Jasmine

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree.  Jasmine was used to create test suites to test an pre-made app. 

### Run the project
 
To run the project simply download or clone the project repository and open index.html in your browser.  The page will display the app - a feed reader from several sites with a list of articles and a menu to move between site sources.  Jasmine will also open on the page with the results of 7 specification expectations spread across 3 main 'describe' functions that were created to test thekey functionality of the page.  The 3 functions with associated spec expectations are as follows.

1.RSS Feeds: 
* Are they defined?       
* Do they have a valid url?
* Is the url a valid name?

2.Menu: 
* Is the menu hidden by default?
* Does it change visibility when clicked?

3.Initial Entries:
* Does it have at least one '.entry' element in its '.feed' container?

New Feed Selection: 
* Is it loading content that changes?
